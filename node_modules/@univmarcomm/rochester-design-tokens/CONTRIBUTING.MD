# Contributing to the design tokens repository

The design tokens project team welcomes contributions!

## Making changes to design tokens

This repository is currently a prototype. Upon approval, the Web Governance Council will oversee the naming and values of design tokens.

If you wish to make suggestions for changes to tokens, document your requests until the governance process has been defined. There will be opportunities for feedback and proposals.

## Making other code or documentation contributions

_This documentation is a work-in-progress._

If you find or bug or have ideas for how to improve the package, please [submit an issue to the repository](https://git.its.rochester.edu/univmarcomm/rochester-design-tokens/-/issues).

If you would like to submit the code change yourself, create a new branch based off the **main** branch and create a merge request to the **main** branch.
